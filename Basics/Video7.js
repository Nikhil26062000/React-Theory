!1. React-router-dom:
        -useRouterError() will give us the error related to routing like 404 error page not found

2. Difference b/w client side routing and server side routing . use chatGPT to find answer
        -In client-side routing, routing is handled entirely by the web browser. When a user navigates to a different URL within the application, the browser updates the URL in the address bar and loads the appropriate content without making a round trip to the server.

        -In server-side routing, routing is handled by the web server. When a user navigates to a different URL, the browser sends a request to the server, which responds with the appropriate HTML content for that URL.

! just for the understanding : if want to fetch details of individual restaurants cards on clicking i.e creating dynamic card on clicking on restaurant then see video : -12:00

3. <link> in React : behind the scene Link is also using <a> tag of html but react see that oh its a Link  so we dont need to refresh the page .
        -  html dont understand <Link> so <Link> behind the scene using <a> tag to redirect but there will be some logic that finds that ohh its Link so we only have to rdirect but not to refresh the page.
        !-Link is a wrapper over <a/> tag
